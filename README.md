# Official-HTML-Related-Projects-Birthday-Email
This repository is only available for my personal HTML related content/assignments.

To see the layout of the birthday email:

1. Launch any contemporary web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and open `index.html`.
2. Verify that the `images/` folder (fallbacks) and the `root/` folder (GIFs and videos) are located in the same directory.
3. Test on both desktop and mobile screen sizes for optimal outcomes.

## Email Clients' Limited Media Support

The majority of popular email programs, including Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail, fully support GIFs.
There is little support for videos. `<video>` tags are completely removed by Gmail and Outlook.
  For clients that are not supported, fallback images are offered.
  - Autoplay may not function in every setting and requires the `muted` attribute.
- **Accessibility**: To guarantee compatibility and clarity, all media have meaningful `alt` text and backup images.

## Remarks

In the browser, this arrangement mimics an email-style message.
Due to media handling and CSS limitations, actual email clients may display differently.
